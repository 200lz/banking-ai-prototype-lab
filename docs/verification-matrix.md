# Authoritative verification matrix

Recorded 2026-09-09. PASS means the stated scope was actually executed. SDK mocks,
offline synthesis, container images and local file adapters never establish a real
cloud/data-platform integration. NOT APPLICABLE means the column does not apply to
that capability; NOT TESTED means an applicable integration was not executed.

## Evidence supporting PASS

- **GitHub Actions: PASS.** Independently queried with `gh`: workflow
  `Quality and safety regression`, [run 34344534926](https://github.com/200lz/banking-ai-prototype-lab/actions/runs/34344534926),
  commit `827888ab0d3c82f937d8106b51f8bf04f4a3fcc4` on `main`. Job `quality`
  passed all 22 recorded steps on GitHub-hosted Linux (`ubuntu-latest`, runner
  `GitHub Actions 1000000254`, group `GitHub Actions`). Gates covered dependency
  installation, formatting/lint/types, Python/API/infrastructure/frontend tests,
  evaluation smoke/full gates, security analysis/dependency audits, production
  Next.js build, credential-free CDK synthesis, source/complete-history secret
  scans, fresh Docker build, health, scenarios, telemetry, restart and cleanup.
  Artifact preservation passed; actual artifact `evidence-and-infrastructure`
  (ID `10101336517`, 119,231 bytes) was present and unexpired when checked.
  [REPORT](../REPORT.md#github-hosted-ci-pass) records the artifact digest and
  runner evidence. These checks do not establish AWS, live LLM or workspace execution.
- **Local workflow, safety, arithmetic, adapters and CDK:** executed Python/API/
  infrastructure tests and scoped regressions, with final command/count record in
  [REPORT](../REPORT.md) and [local verification record](validation/local-final.json).
  Tests of fake vendor clients establish contracts only.
- **61-case baseline:** actual full responses, scorer denominators, timings and
  dataset hash in [latest.json](../evals/results/latest.json); earlier continuation
  runs remain separate. Zero model tokens are expected in deterministic mode.
- **Native web/profile:** actual browser scenario and mobile layout results in
  [browser evidence](validation/browser-2026-09-09.json), captured
  [desktop screenshot](demo/sme-workbench.png), frontend build/tests and actual
  same-origin web-to-API requests recorded in REPORT.
- **Local financial pipeline/profile:** [local data-platform record](validation/databricks-local.json)
  and [Databricks validation](databricks-validation.md), including independent
  formula tests and exact reconstruction from the synthetic source file.
- **Docker:** [canonical fresh-build/runtime report](validation/containers-2026-09-09.json)
  records all four built images, health, six scenarios, controlled exporter,
  restart and cleanup. [SME supplement](validation/container-sme-2026-09-09.json)
  matches those exact image IDs and adds the seventh scenario. Its reused-image
  run does not claim a second fresh build. [Milestone report](milestones/01-containers.md)
  explains preserved failures, fixes and security-check scope.

## External integrations

| Integration | Status | Evidence or blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub repository publication and hosted Actions | PASS | Public repository; hosted Linux run [34344534926](https://github.com/200lz/banking-ai-prototype-lab/actions/runs/34344534926), job `quality`, artifact `evidence-and-infrastructure`; exact commit and gates above. |
| AWS sandbox | NOT TESTED | STS cannot locate credentials; no profile, region or sandbox identity. |
| Live Bedrock | NOT TESTED | No AWS identity/model access; staged harness is ready but no live run exists. |
| Databricks workspace pipeline and Gold read | NOT TESTED | No configured workspace, unified authentication, SQL warehouse/catalog/schema or CLI. |

The verified Node.js 20 action-runtime warning is **NON-BLOCKING**: GitHub forced
the pinned actions onto Node.js 24 and the job passed. Action pins were not
changed, and no warning fix is claimed.

See the [hosted CI evidence](../REPORT.md#github-hosted-ci-pass), [AWS preflight](cloud-validation.md),
[Bedrock runbook](milestone-4-bedrock.md), and
[Databricks validation](databricks-validation.md) for exact next actions.
Authentication was not inferred from an installed connector or elapsed time.
The earlier [GitHub milestone](milestone-2-ci.md) is a historical pre-publication
record; its GitHub NOT TESTED status is superseded by the verified run above.
